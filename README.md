Ore conversion recipes for the Converter that go "backwards" in the base-game conversion order, with a twist.

Unlocked in T9 in a separate milestone.

All Reverse Conversion recipes require a new "Excited SAM" item (Reanimated SAM + Excited Photonic Matter) instead of Reanimated SAM and return Excited Photonic Matter as a byproduct.

Alone, these recipes allow new resource conversions the base game didn't offer, like converting Nitrogen Gas to other materials.
Combined with the base game's resource conversions, any raw resource can be converted to any raw resource, except SAM.
Combined with Somersloops, you can effectively convert SAM to any other raw resource. Slooping the Reverse recipes requires finding a way to deal with the now-excess Excited Photonic Matter. (current intended solutions are using it for the rest of your base or wastefully sinking excited SAM)

Note that no conversions for Oil are offered, as the base game didn't involve it in the loop at all.

TODO

- Balance + practicality testing. Currently:
  - Same SAM cost
  - Half the speed of the vanilla recipe
  - Same recipe variable power bounds
- Current Photonic Matter without sloops is break even. Can fluid system be trusted with that? (McGalleon says yes) Maybe make it so that pre-sloop Reverse recipes require a slight Photonic Matter top-off instead of a break even?
